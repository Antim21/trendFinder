# Trend Finder ðŸ”¦

**Stay on top of trending topics on social media â€” all in one place.**

Trend Finder collects and analyzes posts from key influencers, then sends a Slack notification when it detects new trends or product launches. This has been a complete game-changer for the @firecrawl_dev marketing team by:

- **Saving time** normally spent manually searching social channels  
- **Keeping you informed** of relevant, real-time conversations  
- **Enabling rapid response** to new opportunities or emerging industry shifts  

_Spend less time hunting for trends and more time creating impactful campaigns._
